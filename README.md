# github-tasks.vim

This plugin adds support for [Github
tasks](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents),
letting you turn normal markdown list entries into tasks and toggle them done
or not done. 

### Details

The default keybinding is `tab` in normal mode.

Non-task list entries are turned into tasks. Tasks are toggled between done and not done. 

Example before and after:

| before | after |
| --- | --- |
| `- do stuff` | `- [ ] do stuff` |
| `- [ ] find panda` | `- [x] find panda` |
| `- [x] hunt dagashi` | `- [ ] hunt dagashi` |
